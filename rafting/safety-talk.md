# Safety Talk

### Dynamic and 

### The boat

### Equipment
Paddle and t-grip

Life jackets are tight so that when we pull up on the shoulder straps it stays in place.  Check your partner for any missing buckles and fit.

### Sitting in the boat

### Falling out of the boat
Confirm your safety first, then everyone else. Worry about floating equipment later. 

### Foot entrampment
Do not stand up in the river. Your foot could become lodged underneath a rock, the current pushes you forward, and suddenly you are stuck face down in the water.  This is an extremely difficult rescue.



### White water swimming
Usually swim back to the boat on your stomach and grab the OS line.  When swimming, you may also keep your feet downstream, float flat on your back and push off any rocks with your feet.  You may also swim to other boats.

Try not to float downstream or directly in front of the boat. You don't want to be crushed between the boat and a rock.

Often easier to breathe in during the wave troughs and hold your breath when the waves break over you.

### Hange on to equipment
If you are tossed from a boat, hang onto your paddle if possible.  Control your paddle during the chaos of whitewater action, otherwise you can bloody noses and take out teeth.

### Throw bags
Not usually used from the boat, but can be critical in situations like a swimmer stuck in a wave.  Swim to get the rope. Hold onto the rope, not the bag.  Do not tie or wrap the rope around anything (especially hands and kneck). Hold the rope at your chest, lie on your back and kick to assist the rescue.

### Point positive
Guides point postive while you are swimming, go to the direction the guide is pointing. The guide may point towards shore or another boat as your best option.  Swim hard!

### Be active in your rescue

### Boat flip
Finding yourself underneath the boat – Get out from there. Put your hands above your head and push on the boat, use them like you are walking with your hands.

### High side
If the boat will be striking an obstical like a rock sideways, jump to the side nearest the obstical. If weight isn’t transferred quickly to this side, water can pile up on the upstream side, force the upstream tube under water and the terrific force of the moving water will “wrap” the boat bottom against the rock. Guides will usually use the command "high side right" to mean move quickly to the right side.

### Wood hazards

### Dams, bridge pillers, and human made obstructions

### Paddle commands
- Forward
- Back
- Right side only
- Stop
- Lean in
- Get down

The motor is the paddlers, not the guide. If you turn off the motor then the boat has no steering, power or brakes. Paddle hard.


### Golden rules
- Man
- Follow the diret


### Loost straps
Extra ropes, loops, and items that could clip to people (like non-locking biners) should be avoided.  A non-locking caribiner can attach to a life jacket when a boat flips or a foot can get stuck in a loop and prevent someone from getting their head above water to breath.

### Medical conditions

### Sun protection and hydration



### Other reminders
- Where life jacket all times
- Always follow the guides instruction
- Everyone may point out downstream obsticals
