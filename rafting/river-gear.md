# River Gear

## Required
The five items needed while in the raft are:
- PFD (life jacket)
- Paddle
- Water shoes
- Water clothes
- Helmet

I have a range of water equipment includes extra PFDs, paddles, helmets, and some water clothes like dry tops and wetsuites.  If you need anything, please ask! (I.E. I usually plan on bringing a paddle for everyone each trip)

### PFD
Everyone must have an appropriate sized PFD.  No exceptions.  Any normal PFD should work, which means its a Type III or Type V rescue PFD.  PFDs purchased for water sports are usually Type III and provide more than 15.5 pounds of floatation (exact floatation may not be listed on your PFD).  Type I and Type II PFDs may provide additional floatation benefits, but are often not the best fit for white water.  No Type 5 blowup or special use PFDs.  No raggedy or 20+ year old PFDs.  A PFD is too big if it may be easily pulled over your head when the PFD is grabbed by the shoulder straps.  A PFD is too small if buckles and zippers cannot be closed. 

### Paddle
Bring a paddle if you have it! Otherwise confirm one will be given to you.

### Water shoes
White water "booties" or water shoes with softer bottoms are ideal.  Old tennis shoes work. The best sandles are closed toed (comfortable when jamming one's foot in a thwart) and have a back ankle strap(means they will stay on one's feet if you fall out).  Bare feet are a bad choice because you may need to walk.  Make sure nothing on your footware is sharp and could damage the boat.

### Water clothes
Being cold is unfun and dangerous! Most NW rivers during the summer are fed through melting snow and are cold.  New people to rafting underestimate the amount of clothing they would prefer.  I always recommend wearing a least a wetsuit.  Often more comfortable to wear shorts rather than bikini bottoms (but you do you).  If borrowing any clothing, always try it on once before arriving at the river. 

#### 90's
Remember clothing for sun protection.

#### 80's
Always recommend a wetsuite.

#### 70's
Unless direct sunlight, you probably want a wetsuit with a splashtop.

#### 60's
Thicker wetsuit with synthetic or wool layers on top covered by a splash jacket and rain pants will hold in heat and keep you safe, but you may get cold if you fall in.  Tight fitting rain jacket around the kneck that are not too bulky work as splash tops. Recommend brining a second set of layers in a dry bag.

#### Below 60
Rafting is still a lot of fun if you have the right gear.
