# Tieton Moon Party
This trip should be a different night than the annual Tieton guide party.  It's a moon party!  The full moon is Friday, September 9th and it will be the harvest moon.

Fill out the excel sheet to let us know you are coming and what you may bring: [Tieton Moony Party Excel Sheet](https://buchnerfamilycom.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/EQcmNxh0z2BFuNlQxiF84mAB0azQQEgsMuEITjt2lfktjQ?e=2fNcqu).

**Still in the planning phase, maybe more to come**

## Dates
**10/10/22 - 10/11/22**  - Saturday& Sunday

Optionally stay Friday night.  I will try to nag us a good camping spot on Friday night.  Rafting is on Saturday. Sunday is an unknown, but I want to get back out on the river.  *The moon party is Saturday night.*

## Where?
Tieton.  Camping is probably [South Fork Tieton Dispersed Camping](https://goo.gl/maps/wPCtxpWSKfJeWwqn9).


## What's a Moon Party?
We are going first to raft. 

But similar to moon starting to wane, our rivers are waning now as there is less water until the snow and rain fall again.  

If you are staying the night be prepared to purge something in the fire.  This may as simple as writing something you want to let go of on a piece of paper and throwing it in the fire.  The moon is waning and you too should let go of something.

You recongnize the moon's brightness through wearing a glow stick, glow in the dark face paint, or glow in the dark glitter.  This will be available.

Anyone can bring anything else they feel a moon party needs.  Often moon parties include tarot card readings, crystals, or candles...and if you want that, you do you and you are supported!

I expect a chill, camp fire vibe, rather than a bumping party ;).  But got a the theme and who knows!

## Who is invited?
Anyone who is a friends with us (our guide class + our invites, etc.)--especially if they rafted with us this year!  Maybe it will be like four of us, maybe it will be like sixteen of us, let's make it a party! *Not really prepared for more than like 20?*

RSVP through the [Excel sheet](https://buchnerfamilycom.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/EQcmNxh0z2BFuNlQxiF84mAB0azQQEgsMuEITjt2lfktjQ?e=2fNcqu), especially to make sure we have enough spots in rafts.  **We are looking for more rafts!**
