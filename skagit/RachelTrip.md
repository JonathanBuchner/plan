## Where are we going? 
The Skagit river runs along highway 20 in the North Cascades.  The put in is beneath Newhalem Dam just inside the North Cascades National Park.  Above the dam is Ross Lake.  While this part of the river is in the park, further up is a beutiful Mountinous part of America, which is why it is a National Park.

## Put In 
Putin Goodell Creek Campground is at mile 119.4 on Highway 20. There is a boat launch and information sign at the downstream end of the campground. A small beach and unload area provides a place for staging and is convenient for rafts. Ample parking is on the street adjacent to the launch area. Above is Gorge Powerhouse which is at mile 120.9 but there is no formal river access.

## Ride
Early on there is a class II rapid section called Goodell.  Afterwards you reach S Bends rapid, which is a series of three rapids and their size is based on flow. There is a small hole (which we can avoid or hit) in the middle of the river towards the bottom of the rapid.  These rapids are small at this water level.  Most of the trip is paddling through flat water. 


We will bring drinks.

## Take Out
Take out is at mile 111.7 on Highway 20 there is a dirt road (NPS Road 213) leading south to the river (it's just before you reach the Ross Lake Recreation Area sign). Follow the dirt road and take the left fork to a takeout about 200 yards from the highway. Parking options are limited here.

## Weather
As of a week out, it looks to be in the high 60's and possible clouds.
