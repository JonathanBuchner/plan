You turn off of Highway 2 at Coles Corner onto 207 North (Lake Wenatchee Highway).
- After the Wenatchee river bridge, slight right onto Chiwawa Loop Road (1.3 mi)
- Turn left onto Chiwawa River Rd (22.1 mi). *More than ten miles is a slow dirt road.  No low clearance cars*
- Slight right onto Phelps Creek Forest Service 6211 Rd/Phelps Creek Trailhead Rd (2.4 mi)

### Parking
NW TrailPass is required (double check?). Northwest Forest Pass (or Recreation Day Passes) are required at trailheads on adjacent U.S. Forest Service land with trails leading into the national parks.  No pass listed as required at WTA.

I believe no water nor bathroom at trailhead.

## Trail
At 3500ft you leave the Phelps Creek Trailhead and walk on the right of Phelps Creek about 5.5 miles to meadow opening to camp below 4800ft.  The trail continues through the basin and up to spider pass (5300ft).  There are several creeks to cross with the largest being leroy creek which are delicate to cross without water proof boots.

## Camping

## Weather
### Snow
It's still snowing on occasion at 5000ft and the snowpack is 200% than usual accross WA (6/13/22, see below).  On 6/13/22 there is about two feet of snow at Steven's Pass at 4000ft and we will be just below 5000ft.  I would assume there are difficult snow crossings to get to Spider Pass in mid July, but that we will cross intermittent snow fields and no snow on campsites.
