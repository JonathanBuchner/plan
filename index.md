You turn off of Highway 2 at Coles Corner onto 207 North (Lake Wenatchee Highway).
- After the Wenatchee river bridge, slight right onto Chiwawa Loop Road (1.3 mi)
- Turn left onto Chiwawa River Rd (22.1 mi). *More than ten miles is a slow dirt road.  No low clearance cars*
- Slight right onto Phelps Creek Forest Service 6211 Rd/Phelps Creek Trailhead Rd (2.4 mi)

### Parking
**No** NW TrailPass required. (double check?) Passes are required at trailheads on adjacent U.S. Forest Service land with trails leading into the national parks.  No pass listed as required at WTA.  I believe no water nor bathroom at trailhead.

## Trail
At 3500ft you leave the Phelps Creek Trailhead and walk on the right of Phelps Creek about 5.5 miles to meadow opening to camp below 4800ft.  The trail continues through the basin and up to spider pass (5300ft).  There are several creeks to cross with the largest being Leroy creek which are delicate to cross without water proof boots.

## Camping

### Party size
Max party size is 12 person.  Buchner + Lovell + Henjum is at 11. 

### Sites
Crowded area so there are many camps, which fill up on Fri/Sat.  Possible not all tents fit right next to each other.  There are outdoor toilets of possibly varying quality. Mix of sun and shade camping probably.

### Bugs
Even with the snow recently melted be ready with clothing to completely cover and prevent yourself from being bit, *especially for kids.*  

## Food
On 6/13 all parties are recommended to figure out there own snacks, drinks, breakfast, and lunches.  Jonathan is happy to organize bring gnocchi(fried) and tortellini(a derek backpacking favorite) if we want to organize a group dinner.


## Weather
### Snow
It's still snowing on occasion at 5000ft and the snowpack is 200% than usual accross WA (6/13/22, see below).  On 6/13/22 there is about two feet of snow at Steven's Pass at 4000ft and we will be just below 5000ft.  I would assume there are difficult snow crossings to get to Spider Pass in mid July (Above us), but that we will cross intermittent snow and no snow on campsites by mid July.

### Rain
If rain, Jonathan will bring at least one 10 by 14ft shelter to eat / play under. There will be dry cook and play space.  Everyone would need rain gear, consider rain pant option for kidos because the high grass will soak legs/socks.
