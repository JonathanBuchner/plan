- There is no shared gear list, but Bree, I am happy to bring one set of stove stuff that I can carry.

## Food
For group food Jonathan and Ashley will bring:
- Tortellini for dinner 
- A simple dessert
- Two cans of wine and 10oz whiskey
- Some extra trail snacks for the group (including sweets for Alpen)

Each party is will figure out there own Breakfasts (including coffee etc.), lunch, and snacks.  Probably no lunch needed for hike out on Sunday.

## Notes
- I haven't done a lot of research, so reading over some trip reports and checking
my information above would be helpful.
- Looks like Saturday has the best weather for entire week.
- Group gear, how we do food, meet time, etc. can be discussed and if you have a preference, lets do it.
