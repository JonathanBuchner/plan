- Remember that there are over 10 "Blue Lakes" in Washington.  This is the one in Indian Heaven Wilderness.  Blue lake used to have a 1.5 mile access through a CLOSED ROAD.  Make sure you get directions to the Thomas Lake Trailhead.


## Location
Blue Lake is located on the south side of the Indian Heaven Wilderness on the pacific crest trail.

## Gear
There is no shared gear list, but Bree, I am happy to bring one set of stove stuff that I can carry.

## Food
For group food Jonathan and Ashley will bring:
- Tortellini for dinner 
- A simple dessert
- Two cans of wine and 10oz whiskey
- Some extra trail snacks for the group (including nut and sweet snack for Alpen)

Each party is will figure out there own Breakfasts (including coffee etc.), lunch, and snacks.  Probably no lunch needed for hike out on Sunday.

## Sites
Picture below is pre scouted camp sites.  We are going to Blue Lake on the right and will walk past Thomas Lake (it's super close to the car).

- Looks like Saturday has the best weather for entire week!
- Group gear, how we do food, meet time, etc. can be discussed and if you have a preference, lets do it.
- Let's go!
