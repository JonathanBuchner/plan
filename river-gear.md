## Required
The five items needed to raft are:
- Life jacket
- Paddle
- Water shoes
- Water clothes
- Helmet

### Life jacket
Everyone must have an appropriate sized life jacket.  No exceptions.  Any normal life jacket should work, which means a Type III or Type V rescue jacket.  Life jackets purchased for water sports are usually Type III and provide more than 15.5 pounds of floatation (exact floatation may not be listed on your jacket).  Type I and Type II jackets may provide additional floatation benefits, but are often not the best fit for white water sports.  No Type 5 blowup or special use jackets.  No raggedy or 20+ year old jackets.  A jacket is too big if it may be easily pulled over your head when the jacket is grabbed by the shoulder straps.  A jacket is too small if buckles and zippers cannot be closed. 

### Paddle
Bring a paddle if you have it, otherwise confirm one will be given to you.

### Water shoes
Booties or water shoes with softer bottoms are ideal.  Old tennis shoes work. Sandles that are closed toe are more comfortable for jamming one's foot in a thwart and you won't bend back an toenails.  Sandles with backs means they will stay on one's feet when you fall out.  Bare feet are a bad choice because one may need to walk.  Make sure nothing on your footware is sharp and could damage the boat.

### Water clothes
Being cold can be unfun, but more importantly, dangerous! Most NW rivers during the summer are fed through melting snow and are cold.  

A dry suit or dry top is ideal, but cost between $350 - $1200.  Thicker wetsuit with synthetic or wool layers on top covered by a splash jacket and rain pants will hold in heat and keep you safe, but you may get cold if you fall in.  Tigh fitting rain jackets around the kneck that are not too bulky work as splash tops. Recommend brining a second set of layers in a dry bag.
