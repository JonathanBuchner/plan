## Required
The five items needed to raft are:
- Life jacket
- Paddle
- Water shoes
- Water clothes
- Helmet

### Life jacket
Everyone must have fitted life jacket.  No exceptions.  Any normal life jacket should work, which means a Type III or appropriate Type V.  Most life jackets purchased for water sports are Type III and provide at least 15.5 pounds floatation (exact floatation may not be listed on your jacket).  Type 1 and Type 2 may provide additional floatation benefits, but vary on their appropriateness for rafting.  No Type 5 blowup or special use jackets.  No raggedy or 20+ year old life jackets.

### Paddle
Bring a paddle if you have it, otherwise confirm one will be given to you.

### Water shoes
Booties or water shoes with softer bottoms are ideal.  Old tennis shoes work. Sandles that are closed toe are nice for jamming one's foott in a thwart.  Sandles with backs means they will stay on your feet when you fall out.  Bare feet is a bad choice because you may need to walk.  Make sure nothing on your footware is sharp and could damage the boat.

### Water clothes
Expect the water to be cold

#### 80+

#### 70+
Unless direct sunlight, you probably want a wetsuit with a splashtop

#### 60+

#### Below 60
A dry suit or dry top is ideal, but the cost will be between $350 - $1200.  Thicker wetsuit with synthetic or wool layers on top covered by a splash jacket and rain pants will hold in heat and keep you safe, but you may get cold if you fall in.  Tigh fitting rain jackets around the kneck that are not too bulky work as splash tops. Recommend brining a second set of layers in a dry bag.
